        <div class="placeholder">Indentation and scope in code work just like organizing sections on a webpage using HTML and CSS.
Think of curly braces { } as containers, just like a div in HTML.
Everything inside those braces belongs to that specific section.
Indentation is simply pushing the lines inside a bit to visually show, “these items are part of this container.”
It doesn’t change how the browser works, but it helps humans understand structure.
Just like nested div's, the deeper something is indented, the more it belongs to a smaller, more specific part.
Scope means “this code only applies inside these braces,” similar to styles applied inside one section only.</div>
        <div class="placeholder">
For me curly braces in code are a great metaphor for personal boundaries.
Think of each { } as a clear space that belongs to you—your feelings, your time, your comfort.
Everything inside those braces is what you allow into your life.
Indentation is the way you organize and communicate those boundaries so others can understand them clearly.
When the brace closes, it signals, “this is where my limit ends.”
Just like in code, boundaries don’t restrict—they create clarity, reduce confusion, and keep things from mixing in unhealthy ways.
Respecting someone’s braces means respecting the space they need to feel safe and understood.</div>
